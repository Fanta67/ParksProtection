Comments:	As requested, we added new images and Wikipedia descriptions for plants and animals.
			Most work as intended, but parsing for the Wikipedia descriptions isn't standardized 
			while some species just have a 1-line description, which is why some
			are short. We truly don't know why some of the new images aren't there and why some aren't
			https, because we checked status codes and urls while scraping. In fact, opening images
			that are fetched in http or show up as missing on the frontend in a new tab reveals that
			they both exist and still have https, so we're assuming this is just related to the
			third-party servers purosefully blocking requests and sending data over http themselves,
			but we'd still like to aplogise for not having them down perfectly. They do work for most
			of the website though, so we hope that's good enough and that there's no need for us to
			go back and mess around with more than 5 APIs.
